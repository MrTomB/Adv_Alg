Program 3 Templates and Iterators

In this assignment, I implemented template code and use no template
classes from the STL. I also wrote my own code to handle file I/O.

Only the following include statements were used:
    <cassert>, <cerrno>, <cstdlib>, <exception>, <fstream>,
    <iomanip>, <iostream>, <stdexcept>, <string>, <typeinfo>.

NAME
     keyvalue -- manage a list of key and value pairs

SYNOPSIS
     keyvalue [-@ flags] [filename...]

DESCRIPTION
     Input is read from each file in turn.  Before any processing,
     each input line is echoed to cout, preceded by its filename and
     line number within the file.  The name of cin is printed as a
     minus sign (-).

     Each non-comment line causes some action on the part of the
     program, as described below.  Before processing a command,
     leading and trailing white space is trimmed off of the key and
     off of the value.  White space interior to the key or value is
     not trimmed.  When a key and value pair is printed, the
     equivalent of the format string used is "%s = %s\n".  Of course,
     use <iostream>, not <stdio>.  The newline character is removed
     from any input line before processing.  If there is more than one
     equal sign on the line, the first separates the key from the
     value, and the rest are part of the value.  Input lines are one
     of the following:

     #
          Any input line whose first non-whitespace character is a
          hash (#) is ignored as a comment.  This means that no key
          can begin with a hash.  An empty line or a line consisting
          of nothing but white space is ignored.

     key
          A line consisting of at least one non-whitespace character
          and no equal sign causes the key and value pair to be
          printed.  If not found, the message
               key: key not found
          is printed.  Note that the characters in italics are not
          printed exactly.  The actual key is printed.  This message
          is printed to cout.

     key =
          If there is only whitespace after the equal sign, the key
          and value pair is deleted from the map.

     key = value
          If the key is found in the map, its value field is replaced
          by the new value.  If not found, the key and value are
          inserted in increasing lexicographic order, sorted by key.
          The new key and value pair is printed.

     = 
          All of the key and value pairs in the map are printed 
          in lexicographic order.

     = value
          All of the key and value pairs with the given value are 
          printed in lexicographic order sorted by key
