Unix Shell Emulation

This assignment emulates the unix shell. Users can create text files and
directories and get information on the current state of the shell.

The available commands are:
	# string					If the first non-space character on a line is a hash,
								the line is a comment and is ignored.

    cat pathname...             The contents of each file is copied to stdout. 

    							An error is reported if no files are specified,
    							a file does not exist, or is a directory

    cd [pathname]               The current directory is set the the pathname given.
    							If no pathname is specified, the root directory (/) is used.

    							It is an error if the pathname does not exist or is a plain file,
    							or if more than one operand is given.

    echo [words...]             The string, which may be empty, is echoed to stdout on a line by itself.

    exit [status]               Exit the program with the given status.
    							If the status is missing, exit with status 0.
    							If a non-numeric argument is given, exit with status 127.

    ls [pathname...]            A description of the files or directories are printed to stdout. 
    							If no pathname is specified, the current working directory is used.
    							If a pathname specified is a directory, then the contents of the directory are listed.
    							A directory listed within a directory is shown by a terminating slash.
    							Elements of a directory are listed lexicographically.
								For each file listed, output consists of the inode number, then the size,
								then the filename. Output is lined up into columns and each column is
								separated from the next by two spaces. The numeric fields are exactly 6
								characters wide and the units position in a column must be aligned.
								It is an error if any of the file or directory does not exist.

    lsr [pathname...]           As for ls, but a recursive depth-first preorder traversal is done for subdirectories.

    make pathname [words...]    The file specified is created and the rest of the words are put in that file.
								If the file already exists,anew one is not created, but its contents are
								replaced. If there are no words, the file is empty.
								It is an error to specify a directory.

    mkdir pathname              A new directory is created. 
    							It is an error if a file or directory of the same name already exists,
    							or if the complete pathname to the parent of this new directory does not already exist.
    							Two entries are added to the directory, namely dot (.) and dotdot (..).
    							Directory entries are always kept in sorted lexicographic order.

    prompt string               Set the prompt to the words specified on the command line. 

    pwd                         Prints the current working directory.

    rm pathname                 The specified file or directory is deleted (removed from its parent’s list of
								files and subdirectories).
								It is an error for the pathname not to exist. If the pathname is a directory,
								it must be empty.

    rmr pathname                A recursive removal is done, using a depth-first postorder traversal.
